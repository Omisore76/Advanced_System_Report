# Advanced_System_Report

This script is a great way to get information about your computer's performance.

It contains a menu with four options, each configured to display different information about your computer. To choose an option, simply enter the corresponding number when prompted. 

Let's start with option 1, shall we? If you choose this option, you'll be able to see how much disk space is being used. This is handy if you're trying to figure out why your computer is running slow or if you're running out of space.

Option 2 is all about file space usage. This is useful for determining which programs take up the most space on your hard drive. If you're noticing your computer is sluggish, this is a good place to start investigating.

Option 3 will show you the amount of free and used memory on your system. This can be helpful if you're trying to figure out why your computer is crashing or trying to free up some memory.

And finally, option 4 will display the system uptime. This is handy if you're trying to figure out how long your computer has been running without crashing or if you're trying to troubleshoot a problem.

Entering 0 will exit the menu.
